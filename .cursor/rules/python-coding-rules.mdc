## General Coding Guideline
### Description:
Requires detailed Google-style docstrings for all functions, methods, and classes.
### globs:
**/*.py


- For any python file, be sure to ALWAYS add typing annotations to each function or class
- Be sure to include return types when necessary.
- Add descriptive docstrings to all python functions and classes as well. Please use pep257 convention.
- When writing tests, make sure that you ONLY use pytest or pytest plugins, do NOT use the unittest module
- All tests should have typing annotations as well.
- All tests should be in ./tests. Be sure to create all necessary files and folders
- All tests should be fully annotated and should contain docstrings
- Use formatters and linters specified under pyproject.toml

## Modular Deisgn
description: Promotes modular design with distinct files for models, services, controllers, and utilities.
globs: *

- Split logic into functions, classes, and modules.
- Avoid long scripts with intertwined logic.
- Follow single-responsibility principle (SRP).
